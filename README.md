# FileFox32
FileFox32 is a self learning and resource development projects. It is a part of
the [RedFox32 project](https://github.com/users/RedFox0x20/projects/1) series.
Here I will design and develop the FileFox32 Filesystem, this includes the
development and storage of all documentation and design choices. In addition all
utilities for accessing the Filesystem on commonly used operating systems,
primarily Linux and other systems.

_Note: I do not run Operating Systems such as Windows, MacOS or BSD. If you
would like to contribute and create changes so that these systems are supported
then I will introduce a method to do so further down the line. If you are
reading this, please do not attempt to contribute changes at the current time,
thank you._
